ctrl shift p to make flutter project
changed dependency from android->app->build.gradle ; in defaultConfig the applicationId(keep it unique)
add that google_services.json file in the required location(this file will tell which backend to connect to)
open build.gradle in android folder(not the one in android->app)
change dependencies to classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1' (problem with other version)

now open android->app->build.gradle and do the told changes
change min sdk version to 21 in defaultConfig class

install flutter packages to interact firebase at the backend ->firebase_auth & cloud_firestore

myapp - root widget
wrapper widget - listen for authentication(user logged in or logged out)
depending on the logged in status:
authenticate screen - not logged in:
	sign in
	register
home screen - logged in: (going to wrap the following widget)
	brewlist widget- show the hot drink preferences
	settings widget - update the data


#########$$$$$$#########
root : main.dart
wrapper is the widget which listens to auth changes and will either show home.dart or authenticate.dart

enable authentication methods in firebase project
in sign in method enable email/password and anonymous

a separate class will handle all the diff authentication phases{auth.dart}


we got an object in which a lot of info we don't need. so now when we receive 
the result, we want to convert it into an object which just contains the info we need(uid over here)
and create a user class(for this purpose, we create user.dart)


stream b/w flutter app and firebase auth service. firebase auth service emits everytime when user signs in
or sign out. when signed out ->returns null, when signed in-> return user object.
based on these values we get, our flutter app updates the ui appropriately
firebase auth service has stream built into it by invoking the func called onAuthChange

after setting up auth Stream setup, we want to use it at the root of application to know
whether the user is logged in or not in and coz then we can display it at wrapper widget either auth or home screen
to listen to auth changes we gonna use provider package(to install search provider in pub.dev)

firestore database setup:
cloud firestore, start in test mode, select central usa
we can have collection for different data(for ex-user data, book data for book website)
each collection has documents and each document will represent one record in that collection
each record/document will look like an object(i.e. for one person)
each record/document will represent one particular user
record will have key-value pair(ex-strength is the key and its number will be the value)

after new user registers, create new record in the brews collection for that user(initially 0 sugar & 0 strength)

linking of firebase user and firestore document(after sign up we get unique id, take that id and create new
document in the brews collection)

set up a stream to the firestore document, listening to the data and pre populating the form with the initial
data->so we will create the stream in database service class and also create user data model

different way of listening to stream and using the data:stream builder
we only need to access stream data in this widget(form widget) and not any other widgets by 
declaring like Provider.of...(to access in different widgets)

when we first start, and the bottom sheets widget first loads, we don't assign values to the 3 values. They are null
to begin with, and if we don't edit it, then when we update it, we are saving null values to the DB. This should not
happen. They should have a value, if not then we'll provide fallback value and we'll save that to the databae

After pressing update, it updates in the home as well. the if condition in onPressed of 'Update',sends the data to DB,
to the firestore collection brews,finds the record with the given id and updates those values. we have an active stream
inside home which listens for data changes for brews
